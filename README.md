A restaruant based of true hard core fundamentals, opened by a first generation American family. Who hasn't forgotton what true hard work 
and dedication means to the community. 

I want to have a website that is functionality able to use on a mobile device while not missing out on anything that would be shown on a 
PC. A clean format, that is easy to navigate and also detailed. A reservation form online so customers won't have to call in and be on hold or
have to wait in long lines.

All of these things put together will give the user easy and managable interface to use. It wasll adhere to the clients needs, while also inviting
new customers to the page.
