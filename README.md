# nvwebdev.github.io
A restaruant based of true hard core fundamentals, opened by a first generation American family. Who hasn't forgotton what true hard work 
and dedication to the community. 

A website that is functional to use on a mobile device while not missing out on anything that would be shown on a 
PC. A clean format, that is easy to navigate and also detailed. A reservation form online so customers won't have to call in and be on hold or have to wait in long line.

I want the user to have a easy experience while getting all the information they are looking for.
